## 🔑Tips
A lot of people quiver when they first see the long list of leetcode problems.

However, there is nothing to worry, just remember:
##### 1. Practice one type of question at a time, this is extremely important!
- Once you do ten or more problems of the same type, you will automatically find the rules.

- This is to keep you motivated.
- If you can solve the intermidiate level of problems very easily, it's time to change another type.
